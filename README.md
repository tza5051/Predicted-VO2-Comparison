Welcome
We designed this app to better understand variations between VO2 predicted values among commonly used reference equations.

Please enter all the required information under the Input Parameters and click 'Calculate'.
This will generate different percent predicted VO2 max values for each of the equations listed.

The graphs displayed at the bottom are designed to illustrate the impact of weight/BMI on predicted VO2 max values.
To visualize this relationship, we have plotted predicted VO2 max across a range of weights (from 50kg to 150kg) for each equation used.
Additionally, the predicted VO2 max at the measured weight is indicated by a blue dot, and the predicted VO2 max at the ideal weight is marked by a red dot.
The dashed vertical line represents the predicted VO2 max at the selected BMI, which can be adjusted using the slider below.
